# ZUGABE
This tool automates much of the installation of h-encore.

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)

## Features
- Automatically download required tools and files
- Use already downloaded files, not requiring another download
- Guide users through the installation

## Usage
Download from the releases section, extract it and run the executable.
It's heavily based on TheFlow's own usage guide, just automating as many things as possible. Therefore it should work on all vita systems. This tool was tested on a PSVita 1000.

## Building
Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition was tested. Might work in other IDEs as well.

## Todo
- Automate entering the AID
- Mac/Linux Compatibilty
- Fix bugs (you tell me!)
