# ZUGABE

This tool automates much of the installation of h-encore. It's still in very eraly development and currently unusable.

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

## About
This tool automates the install process of thefl0w's h-encore exploit for PS Vita, at least everything that can be done on the PC and it's built to run on Mac and Linux. 
When run on Windows, it will download and start [auto-h-encore](https://github.com/noahc3/auto-h-encore).
